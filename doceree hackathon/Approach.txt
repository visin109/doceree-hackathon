Approach:
1.Data Preprocessing: The ad server logs need to be preprocessed before building the model.Checked unique values,null percentage, 
Handled missing values,removed duplicates

2. EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis):
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed for your problem statement to gain insights 
and understand the dataset. It helps in cleaning and preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, 
identifying relationships between variables wrt to target varaibles(hcp or not), 
visualizing data patterns etc,EDA provides a foundation for further analysis and decision-making, 
ensuring data quality and aiding in addressing the problem statement effectively.

2.Feature Selection: Relevant features need to be selected or engineered from the ad server logs to 
capture important information related to HCP classification and specialization. We also removed unnecessary columns here.
This may involve extracting information from the user agent, URL, keywords, or other fields that could be indicative of an HCP's behavior or specialization.

3.Feature Engineering: In the feature engineering step, several techniques were applied to process and 
encode the features in the dataset. Specifically, the "KEYWORDS" column was converted into numerical vector representations using a word2vec model. 
This allowed capturing the semantic meaning and similarity between different medical keywords.
Additionally, other important features were encoded using various methods such as one-hot encoding , label encoding, and count encoding. 
One-hot encoding is used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, label encoding assigns a unique numerical label to each category, 
and count encoding represents each category with the count of its occurrences(used for URL’s).

4.Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms can be employed to train a classification model on the preprocessed data. 
This included algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or deep learning approaches. 
Model Used:Random Forest Regression
Accuracy on validation:94
For this we used Random forest classifier because Random Forest has the ability to capture complex feature interactions and non-linear relationships between features. 
In the case of given dataset of categorical variables, RF can automatically learn and consider interactions 
between different categories within a feature especially with lots of medical terms which can be critically used to identify taxonomy and hcp’s.

5. Model validation: Divided feature_matrix into train and validation datsset(75:25).
As target variable is not present in test dataset we can assess the performance of model. So we used validation dataset to tune our model to achieve better accuracy
and validated it using kflod cross validation method.Evaluated using appropriate metrics such 
as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its performance in classifying users as HCPs and predicting their specializations.

6.Filling Taxonomies:
Created a taxonomy map with entire keyword and taxonomy and keyword taxonomy map with each medical term with its list of associated taxonomies.
For predicted hcp who are hcp are first compared with taxonomy_dict and corresponding taxonomies are filled.
For Keywords that don’t match, the cosine similarity between the keyword vector of each row in the 
dataframe and the keyword vectors in the keyword_vector1 dictionary. 
It finds the top similar keywords based on the highest similarity scores and retrieves their associated taxonomies from the keyword_taxonomy_map. 
It then determines the most common taxonomy among the top neighbors and updates the 'taxonomy' column in the dataframe.

7.By classifying users as HCPs and predicting their specializations, 
this solution enables targeted advertising campaigns in the healthcare domain. 
Advertisers and marketers can leverage this information to deliver more relevant and personalized advertisements to the intended audience, 
resulting in improved engagement and effectiveness of their campaigns.
